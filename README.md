# Sticky.

This is an example sticky note "app" written in modern vanilla JS. You can add, edit, and delete sticky notes, as well as change their color.

It doesn't use any JS frameworks, but the JS classes are somewhat styled similar to React components, in that they have `this.props` and a `render` method.

This isn't intended as a usable app. It's not tested, it's not split into multiple files, and it's not run through Webpack. It will only run in browsers that can handle ES6.
